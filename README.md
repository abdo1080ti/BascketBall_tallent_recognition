# BascketBall_tallent_recognition
1-run the fuse player code first to fuse all the datasets from different limbs into one dataset
2-run the preprocessing code on the new fused dataset
you can skip this part if you want cause I'll send you the fused dataset anyway I just sent it so you can see how i got it
3-There three train_talent_model files you can run them in any order just make sure to change the files paths 
that's bassicly it the rest of the models ( the complicated ones ) still need more data to give decent and acceptable results so I didn't put them in github yet
